dbtrace - (C) 2009 Dave Vasilevsky

Basic demo of tracing DB queries in Drupal
* Just prints to /tmp/dbtrace, obviously this should change!
* Probably works only on Drupal 6
* Traces in realtime, no lost queries if Drupal crashes

Todo
* Write somewhere nicer
* Get pre-substitution query (with % expansions), return values?
* Identify use of last_insert_id?
